Project Title : GreenPath
"Driving Towards a Cleaner Tomorrow”

Idea Description:Green Path – Project Description
Green Path is a sustainable smart mobility and urban development initiative that integrates eco-friendly transportation, renewable energy, and digital technologies to reduce carbon emissions and enhance urban living.
It focuses on:
Smart Transportation: Promoting electric vehicles (EVs), bicycles, and shared mobility platforms with real-time tracking and route optimization.
Green Energy: Using solar-powered charging stations and renewable grids to support EV infrastructure.
IoT & AI Integration: Employing IoT sensors and AI/ML for traffic management, pollution monitoring, and energy optimization.
Sustainable Urban Planning: Designing eco-corridors, green lanes, and smart pathways for pedestrians and cyclists.
Community Engagement: Encouraging citizens to adopt green practices through awareness campaigns, gamification (eco-points), and reward systems.

Objective:
To create a decarbonized, smart, and sustainable urban ecosystem that balances mobility, environment, and technology for future-ready cities.

Key Benefits:

Reduction in carbon footprint

Better traffic flow & reduced congestion

Improved air quality & health

Energy-efficient urban infrastructure

Citizen-friendly smart services

It benefits:
Individuals → reduce fuel cost and drive sustainably.
Enterprises/logistics → monitor fleet emissions and savings.
Cities → reduced congestion and pollution, supporting smart city initiatives.

Problems We Face
High Emissions: Standard GPS ignores environmental impact.
Fuel Waste: Poor route choice + congestion increases consumption.
Urban Congestion: Leads to higher pollution levels.
No Eco Feedback: Drivers don’t know their emission savings.
Data Privacy: Real-time tracking raises security concerns.

Technologies to Use
Programming & Frameworks: Python, Node.js, React Native / Flutter
Data Sources: GPS & Traffic APIs (Google Maps / Mapbox), Weather API (OpenWeather), IoT vehicle sensors
Databases: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (geospatial), MongoDB (trip logs)
Frontend & Visualization: React, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox, Leaflet
Backend & Cloud: FastAPI / Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / GCP
Security: OAuth2, JWT, TLS Encryption, Data Anonymization

Workflow (Step-by-step)
User Inputs: Start and destination in the app.
Data Collection: Fetch GPS, traffic, weather, and vehicle data.
AI Eco-routing Engine: Calculates emissions & fuel cost for each route.
Recommendation: Suggests best eco-route (with eco-score) + alternative routes.
Trip Tracking: Logs journey, fuel/emission savings.
Feedback: User sees eco-score and gamified rewards; enterprise dashboard aggregates fleet data.

Expected Challenges
Real-time data reliability → Use cached/fallback routes.
Model performance on mobile → Deploy lightweight ML models (TensorFlow Lite).
User adoption → Gamification with eco-points and rewards.
Dynamic city events (accidents, jams) → Adaptive re-routing.
Data privacy & security → Encryption + anonymization.
