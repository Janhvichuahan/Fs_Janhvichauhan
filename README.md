Project Title : GreenPath
"Driving Towards a Cleaner Tomorrow”

Idea Description:
Green Path is a smart eco-routing system that helps drivers and fleet operators choose routes that minimize fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions rather than just the fastest distance.
By using AI/ML, real-time traffic, weather, and road condition data, Green Path suggests the greenest possible path.

It benefits:
Individuals → reduce fuel cost and drive sustainably.
Enterprises/logistics → monitor fleet emissions and savings.
Cities → reduced congestion and pollution, supporting smart city initiatives.

Problems We Face
High Emissions: Standard GPS ignores environmental impact.
Fuel Waste: Poor route choice + congestion increases consumption.
Urban Congestion: Leads to higher pollution levels.
No Eco Feedback: Drivers don’t know their emission savings.
Data Privacy: Real-time tracking raises security concerns.

Technologies to Use
Programming & Frameworks: Python, Node.js, React Native / Flutter
AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Reinforcement Learning
Data Sources: GPS & Traffic APIs (Google Maps / Mapbox), Weather API (OpenWeather), IoT vehicle sensors
Databases: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (geospatial), MongoDB (trip logs)
Frontend & Visualization: React, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox, Leaflet
Backend & Cloud: FastAPI / Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / GCP
Security: OAuth2, JWT, TLS Encryption, Data Anonymization

Workflow (Step-by-step)
User Inputs: Start and destination in the app.
Data Collection: Fetch GPS, traffic, weather, and vehicle data.
AI Eco-routing Engine: Calculates emissions & fuel cost for each route.
Recommendation: Suggests best eco-route (with eco-score) + alternative routes.
Trip Tracking: Logs journey, fuel/emission savings.
Feedback: User sees eco-score and gamified rewards; enterprise dashboard aggregates fleet data.

Expected Challenges
Real-time data reliability → Use cached/fallback routes.
Model performance on mobile → Deploy lightweight ML models (TensorFlow Lite).
User adoption → Gamification with eco-points and rewards.
Dynamic city events (accidents, jams) → Adaptive re-routing.
Data privacy & security → Encryption + anonymization.
